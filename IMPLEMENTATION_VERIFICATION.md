# Statement Workflow Implementation Verification

## Requirements Checklist

### ✅ Core Statement Workflow

- [x] **Each user has exactly one Statement with "current" status for Persian (Jalali) month**
  - Implemented in `StatementManager.get_current_statement()`
  - Uses JalaliDate for Persian calendar support

- [x] **Every transaction creates a statementline and updates Statement balance**
  - Implemented in `Statement.add_transaction()` method
  - Automatically updates balances via `update_balances()`

- [x] **Month-end processing safely and reliably:**
  - [x] Change current Statement status to "pending payment"
  - [x] Create new Statement with status "current"
  - [x] New Statement starting balance equals previous closing balance
  - Implemented in `StatementManager.close_monthly_statements()`

- [x] **First transaction on new Statement is interest on previous debt**
  - Implemented in `StatementManager.close_monthly_statements()`
  - Adds 'interest' type statementline automatically

### ✅ Minimum Payment Configuration

- [x] **Grace period per user (configurable)**
  - Implemented via `CreditLimit.get_grace_period_days()`
  - Falls back to `PAYMENT_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS` setting

- [x] **Minimum percentage from Django settings**
  - Added `MINIMUM_PAYMENT_PERCENTAGE` to credit/settings.py
  - Used in `calculate_minimum_payment_amount()`

- [x] **Threshold from Django settings**
  - Added `MINIMUM_PAYMENT_THRESHOLD` to credit/settings.py
  - Used in `calculate_minimum_payment_amount()`

- [x] **Below threshold: no minimum payment required**
  - Implemented in `calculate_minimum_payment_amount()`
  - Returns 0 if debt < threshold

### ✅ Payment Outcomes

- [x] **If minimum paid within grace period:**
  - [x] Set previous Statement to "closed — no penalty"
  - [x] Add repayment line to current Statement
  - Implemented in `process_payment_during_grace_period()`

- [x] **If minimum NOT paid within grace period:**
  - [x] Set previous Statement to "closed — with penalty"
  - [x] Add penalty to current Statement
  - Implemented in `process_payment_during_grace_period()` and `apply_penalty_to_current_statement()`

### ✅ Cleanup of Old Logic

- [x] **Remove all code related to old "few-days grace"**
  - Removed from `AddPaymentView` in credit.py
  - Removed carryover adjustment logic
  - Removed old grace period payment handling

- [x] **Replace with new workflow**
  - New payment processing via management commands
  - New status choices: 'closed_no_penalty', 'closed_with_penalty'

## Implementation Details

### Models Updated

1. **Statement model** (`credit/models/statement.py`)
   - Added new status choices
   - Updated `close_monthly_statements()` method
   - Added new methods for payment processing

2. **StatementLine model** (`credit/models/statement_line.py`)
   - Added 'interest' and 'repayment' line types

3. **Settings** (`credit/settings.py`)
   - Added minimum payment settings
   - Added interest rate settings

### New Management Commands

1. **process_month_end.py** - Handles month-end statement transitions
2. **process_pending_payments.py** - Handles grace period payment processing

### API Updates

- **AddPaymentView** - Simplified to only apply payments to current statement
- Removed old grace period logic

## Usage Instructions

### Month-End Processing

```bash
# Run month-end processing
python manage.py process_month_end

# Dry run to see what would happen
python manage.py process_month_end --dry-run
```

### Payment Processing

```bash
# Process pending payments after grace period
python manage.py process_pending_payments

# Dry run
python manage.py process_pending_payments --dry-run
```

### Configuration

Update these settings in your Django settings:

```python
# Minimum payment settings
MINIMUM_PAYMENT_PERCENTAGE = 0.10  # 10%
MINIMUM_PAYMENT_THRESHOLD = 100000  # 100k Rials

# Interest settings
MONTHLY_INTEREST_RATE = 0.02  # 2% monthly

# Grace period
PAYMENT_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS = 3
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python credit/tests/test_statement_workflow.py
```
